This is working game project, it is a asteroids game I am trying to make into a rogue like with a upgrade system and shop to spend gems.
Currently I am working on making the gems disappear at the end of the game, for some reason they stay even after new game.
I am trying to fix it, I also need to make a settings menu but I put that on the back burner just for now.
Some files belong in a folder, but i dont know how to add folders to git hub
the folders and files are, .vscode - settings.json, components - Bar.lua, Button.lua, SFX.lua, Text.lua, objects - Asteroids.lua, Gems.lua, Lazers.lua, Player.lua, src - data, sounds, data - save.json, sounds - all .mp3/.ogg, states - Game.lua, Menu.lua, Settings.lua, the rest is not in a folder
P.S mute the game, the sound effects where picked by my friends and they get annoying after a few attempts, just a heads up.
