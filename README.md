This is working game project, it is a asteroids game I am trying to make into a rogue like with a upgrade system and shop to spend gems.
currently I am working on making the gems disappear at the end of the game, for some reason they stay even after new game.
I am trying to fix it, I also need to make a settings menu but I put that on the back burner just for now.
P.S mute the game, the sound effects where picked by my friends and they get annoying after a few attempts, just a heads up.
